          <p class = "introText">The financial health of a city is closely intertwined with that of its residents. Financially healthy residents are better able to weather difficult times, are less likely to need city supports and services, and can contribute more to the local economy by supporting property, sales, and income taxes.</p>
          <p class = "introText">Our data dashboard provides a unique snapshot of residents&rsquo; financial health, including credit bureau data, to tell the story of city financial health. Recognizing that cities differ and their residents&rsquo; needs are diverse, we construct city peer groups to highlight shared challenges and promising interventions. What&rsquo;s your city&rsquo;s picture of financial health?</p>
