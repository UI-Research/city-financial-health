        <p class = "introText">The financial health of cities is closely intertwined with that of its residents. Financially healthy residents are better able to weather difficult times, are less likely to need city supports and services, and can contribute more to the local economy by supporting property, sales, and income taxes.</p>
        <p class = "introText">Our data dashboard provides a snapshot of residents’ financial health, including unique credit bureau data, to tell the story of each city’s financial health. While recognizing that every city is different and its residents’ needs diverse, we construct city peer groups to highlight shared challenges and promising interventions. What’s your city’s picture of financial health?</p>
