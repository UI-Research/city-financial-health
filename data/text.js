Nonetheless, these cities are doing well economically, with below average unemployment rates and above average labor force participation. Residents also have high credit health, with median credit scores in the prime range.",
"High housing costs pose a challenge for city residents, making it difficult for them to save for financial emergencies and longer-term investments, like a house or small business. Homebuyers may have to borrow a substantial amount, making them vulnerable to housing market downturns."

["These cities have among the highest shares of low- and moderate-income residents who are housing cost burdened (with the exception of Omaha and Albuquerque). The cities' economic conditions are mixed but typically somewhat above average. Residents’ credit health is generally above average, with median credit scores in the prime range.",
"High housing costs pose a challenge for city residents, making it difficult for them to save for financial emergencies and longer-term investments such as a home."
],
["The economic conditions of these cities hover near the average. Residents have average financial health with median credit scores that are near prime.",
"These cities have the lowest share of low- and moderate-income residents who are housing cost burdened. Lower housing costs may be an opportunity for residents in these cities to build a rainy day fund or save for a home or small business."
],
["These cities have below average economic conditions and most have stagnant or shrinking populations (Atlanta is an exception). Financial security, however, is above average with prime median credit scores. Sizeable racial disparities exist in credit health; these cities have the largest disparity in median credit score between predominantly white and predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods.",
"Ensuring that all residents are doing well financially could help elevate the value of overlooked neighborhoods, increasing the city’s tax, consumer, and entrepreneurship base."
],
["These cities are doing better than average economically with below average unemployment, but have moderate financial security with median credit scores that are near prime to prime.",
"These cities are growing rapidly, which can drive up housing prices and change a city’s economy. Population growth that brings an influx of higher-income residents has the potential to leave some lower-income residents behind as neighborhoods gentrify."
],
["These cities are doing relatively well economically with below average unemployment rates (with the exception of Las Vegas), but have only moderate financial security with median credit scores that are below prime (i.e., near prime). Credit scores that are below prime can limit access to loans and credit cards, making it difficult to weather financial emergencies or invest in the future.",
"High shares of residents in many of the cities do not have health insurance. Five of the eight cities in this peer group are in Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas, which did not expand Medicaid. Lack of health insurance leaves residents exposed to medical bills, which are a primary source of delinquent debt and may contribute to bankruptcy."

["These cities have below average economic conditions, with high unemployment and low labor force participation. Their financial health is below average. Median credit scores are non-prime and high shares of residents have delinquent debt, which can limit access to credit. Also, many low- and moderate-income residents are housing-cost burdened.",
"Lower financial security means that residents are less resilient to economic shocks and less able to borrow and invest. And high housing costs make it difficult for city residents to save for financial emergencies and make ends meet."

["These cities have below average economic conditions, and some have shrinking or slow-growing populations. Their financial health is below average. Median credit scores are non-prime and high shares of residents have delinquent debt, which can limit access to credit.",
"Cities in this peer group tend to have relatively high shares of residents who do not have a bank account. Residents without a bank or credit union account may have a harder time paying bills, saving, accessing credit, investing in a home, or starting a business."
